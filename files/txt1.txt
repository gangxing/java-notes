An ancient Hebraic text says:" love is as strong as death". It seems that not everyone experiences this kind of strong love. The increasing probably,crime and war tells us that the world is in indispensable need of true love. But what is true love? Love is something we all need. But how do we know when we experience it? True love is best seen as the promotion and action, not an emotion. Love is not exclusively based how we feel. Certainly our emotions are involved. But they cannot be our only criteria for love. True love is when you care enough about another person that you will lay down your life for them. When this happens,then love truly is as strong as death. How many of you have a mother, or father,husband or wife,son or daughter or friend who would sacrifice his or her own life on yours? Those of you who truly love your spells but unchildren, would unselfishly lay your life on the line to save them from death? Many people in an emergency room with their loved ones and prayed"please, God,take me instead of them". Find true love and be a true lover as well. May you find a love which is not only strong as death, but to leave to a truly for feeling life.
